Paragraph Title: Paragraph # 1
Paragraph Content: " I have a great deal of difficulty in beginning to write <br /> my portion of these pages, for I know I am not clever. I <br /> always knew that. I can remember, when I was a very <br /> little girl indeed, I used to say to my doll when we were <br />   alone together, \"Now, Dolly, I am not clever, you know <br /> very well, and you must be patient with me, like a dear!\" <br /> And so she used to sit propped up in a great arm-chair, <br /> with her beautiful complexion and rosy lips, staring at <br /> me - or not so much at me, I think, as at nothing - while I <br />  busily stitched away and told her every one of my secrets.<br /> My dear old doll! I was such a shy little thing that I <br /> seldom dared to open my lips, and never dared to open <br /> my heart, to anybody else. It almost makes me cry to think <br /> what a relief it used to be to me when I came home from <br />  school of a day to run upstairs to my room and say, \"Oh, <br /> you dear faithful Dolly, I knew you would be expecting <br /> me!\" and then to sit down on the floor, leaning on the <br /> elbow of her great chair, and tell her all I had noticed <br /> since we parted. I had always rather a noticing way - not <br />  a quick way, oh, no! - a silent way of noticing what passed <br /> before me and thinking I should like to understand it <br /> better. I have not by any means a quick understanding. <br /> When I love a person very tenderly indeed, it seems to <br /> brighten. But even that may be my vanity.<br />  I was brought up, from my earliest remembrance -<br /> like some of the princesses in the fairy stories, only I was <br /> not charming - by my godmother. At least, I only knew <br /> her as such. She was a good, good woman! She went to <br /> church three times every Sunday, and to morning prayers <br />  on Wednesdays and Fridays, and to lectures whenever <br /> there were lectures; and never missed. She was <br /> handsome; and if she had ever smiled, would have been (I <br /> used to think) like an angel - but she never smiled. She <br /> was always grave and strict. She was so very good herself, <br />  I thought, that the badness of other people made her <br /> frown all her life.<br /> I felt so different from her, even making every <br /> allowance for the differences between a child and a <br /> woman; I felt so poor, so trifling, and so far off that I never <br />  could be unrestrained with her - no, could never even <br /> love her as I wished. It made me very sorry to consider <br /> how good she was and how unworthy of her I was, and I <br /> used ardently to hope that I might have a better heart; <br /> and I talked it over very often with the dear old doll, but I <br />  never loved my godmother as I ought to have loved her <br /> and as I felt I must have loved her if I had been a better <br /> girl.<br /> This made me, I dare say, more timid and retiring <br /> than I naturally was and cast me upon Dolly as the only <br />  friend with whom I felt at ease.<br /> I had never heard my mama spoken of. I had never <br /> heard of my papa either, but I felt more interested about <br /> my mama. I had never worn a black frock, that I could <br /> recollect. I had never been shown my mama's grave. I had <br />  never been told where it was. Yet I had never been taught <br /> to pray for any relation but my godmother. I had more <br /> than once approached this subject of my thoughts with <br /> Mrs. Rachael, our only servant, who took my light away <br /> when I was in bed (another very good woman, but <br />  austere to me), and she had only said, \"Esther, good <br /> night!\" and gone away and left me.<br /> Although there were seven girls at the neighboring <br /> school where I was a day boarder, and although they <br /> called me little Esther Summerson, I knew none of them <br />  at home. All of them were older than I, to be sure (I was <br /> the youngest there by a good deal), but there seemed to <br /> be some other separation between us besides that, and <br /> besides their being far more clever than I was and <br /> knowing much more than I did. One of them in the first <br />  week of my going to the school (I remember it very well) <br /> invited me home to a little party, to my great joy. But my <br /> godmother wrote a stiff letter declining for me, and I <br /> never went. I never went out at all."
